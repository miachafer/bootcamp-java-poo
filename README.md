# Creating a bootcamp with OOP and Java

This is a guided challenge of code. The goal was to create a bootcamp using the objects-oriented programming paradigm and Java.

The classes are: 
* Bootcamp: it contains contents such as courses and mentoring sessions
* Devs: developer that can enroll in bootcamps
* Course: course about a subject
* Mentoring session: mentoring session about a subject
* Content: parent class with the class children of course and mentoring session

## DIO

The challenge is part of the [DIO](https://web.dio.me/) bootcamp Java Developer. DIO is one of Latin America largest learning platforms about software developement.

## Learning notes
* Polymorphism is about perform the same action in many different ways.
  * A example is the possibility of instantiate an object using the parent class and not the child class. 

**The forward topics are created by Visual Studio Code as a default README.**

### Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

### Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
